# Console Calculator

This Calculator was made based on the balta.io course.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **.NET Framework**: The framework that provides the necessary libraries and runtime for the application.

## Concepts Learned

During the development of this calculator, I applied several programming concepts, including:

- **Control Flow**:
  - **Switch-case statements**: Implemented for handling user input and directing to the appropriate calculations.

- **Functions**:
  - **Creating Functions**: Developed individual functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - **Function Calls**: Called functions within the main program to execute specific calculations based on user input.

## How to Use

1. Run the application in your terminal.
2. Follow the on-screen menu to select the desired operation.
3. Enter the required numbers for the calculation.
4. The result will be displayed, and the application will automatically return to the menu, allowing you to choose another operation or exit.
